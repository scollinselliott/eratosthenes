The `R` package `eratosthenes` aims to provide a coherent foundation for archaeological chronology-building by incorporating, computationally, all relevant sources of information on uncertain archaeological or historical dates. Archaeological dates are often subject to relational conditions (via seriation or stratigraphic relationships) and absolute constraints (such as radiocarbon dates, datable artifacts, or other known historical events, as _termini post_ or _ante quem_), which prompt the use of a joint conditional probability density to convey those relationships. The date of any one event can then be marginalized from that full, joint conditional distribution, which is achieved using a Gibbs sampler to draw estimates uniformly between potential earliest and latest bounds. Ancillary functions include checking for discrepancies in sequences of events and constraining optimal seriations to known sequences. 

Dates are estimated for the following types of events:

* **deposition**: the marginal density of the date of the final deposition of a context or find-type.
* **externals**: the marginal density of date of any _terminus post quem_ or _terminus ante quem_, as affected by depositional variates in the joint conditional distribution.
* **production**: the marginal density of the production date of a given type or class of artifact, given the stipulation that the type's earliest date of production lies before its earliest date of deposition and after the depositional date of the context immediately prior.

See vignettes for more information on the package functionality. The package requires `Rcpp` for faster Gibbs sampling.

The package is named after Eratosthenes of Cyrene, author of the _Chronographiai_.

## Installation

To obtain the current development version of `eratosthenes` from GitHub, install the package in the `R` command line with `devtools`:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("scollinselliott/eratosthenes", dependencies = TRUE, build_vignettes = TRUE) 
```
